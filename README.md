# Theme-Development

This is a repository for developing my own Web themes. 
I'd like to have the customizability of simple static site, with the
portability and modifiability of a CMS system like Wordpress. So, the solution is
to develop CMS themes. I'm using Wordpress to start, and I'll see in the future
if I switch to another.
